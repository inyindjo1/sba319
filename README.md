This is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to manage a collection of books in a library. Users can create, read, update, and delete book records.

This project demonstrates the basics of working with MongoDB, schema validation, and setting up RESTful routes using Express. It is perfect for learning CRUD operations and how to connect a Node.js app to MongoDB.
